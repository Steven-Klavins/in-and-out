This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is in and out?

In and out in short is a web app to aid the TDD process. Test-driven development (TDD) is a development technique where you must first write a test that fails before you write new functional code. In & Out allows you to add test cases and keep track of which ones are passing as you progress through the TDD process.

## Tech Stack
There is nothing too crazy going on in this app, when hitting the plus button the test component is simply cloned.

## Improvements 
The purpose of making this app was simply to make life a little easier when it came to using input/output tables. It has occurred to me though I could expand on this project and add the ability to delete test cases, save test cases, or even add more TDD tools. I may possibly return to this in the future to do so.
